# CV Template

### Description
This is a simple template to make a CV with Latex. The layout can be further customized by modifying the cv_template.cls file. To enter your own information modify the main.tex file. To enter your own information to the sections "Skills" and "Languages" modify the cv_template.cls file. 

### Possible Improvements
In the main.tex file are still some errors when using "\begin{document}" and "\makesidebar". These could be fixed in the future. However when generating a PDF those errors are not noticable.

### Acknowledgements
Since I am new to Latex I want to thank my friend [@fll128](https://github.com/fll128) for helping me with this template!
